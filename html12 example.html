    <p>
        I was waiting in the reception area at
        <b>PIAIC</b> and i saw copies of <i> Dawn</i>,<i>Jang</i>
        and other reading materials, as well as <cite>Think 
            and Grow Rich</cite>. It is one of my favorite books.
    </p>
    <p>
        I often think on the words from the book, <q>Anyone 
        who holds a true opinion without understanding is like a 
        blind man on the right road</q>. I have a soft copy of
         this book in my tablet as a <abbr title="Portable 
         Document Format">PDF</abbr>. I <em>love</em> reading 
         in my spare time.
